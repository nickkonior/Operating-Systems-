# POSIX_THREADS 
This project demonstrates the use of POSIX Threads and semaphores for thread synchronization in C.  
The program creates three separate threads:  
The first thread prints one  
The second thread prints two  
The third thread prints three  
Using semaphores, the threads are synchronized so that they continuously print the sequence
